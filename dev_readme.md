# Docs roadmap

### Introdution

To check how to implement something go to .tsx file that<br/>
has relation to what do you want to implement and in folder with this file read dev_readme.md<br/>
</br>
In docs I write how something work or how to implement something<br>

For example if you want upderstand how Project.tsx work go to directory `(site)/dev_readme.md`
and there you find info how Project.tsx work

### app/(site)

In this directory you find docs how work/implement something in site
